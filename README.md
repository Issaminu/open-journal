In our digital age, online platforms play a central role in the dissemination of information and community interaction. As a result, the creation and management of websites have become essential. The Open Journal is a project that aims to create a platform for sharing and discussing ideas, opinions and experiences.

The project involves creating a blog with user-generated content, to provide a dynamic and inclusive space where everyone can express themselves, share experiences and interact with a wide audience. The main aim is to develop a user-friendly, feature-rich platform that encourages active participation, varied viewpoints and meaningful interaction between users.
